# Ensemble-Learning-with-Python---Independent-Project

## Background Information<br />
The National Basketball Association (NBA) is an American men's professional basketball
league. It is composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada) and is one
of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.
The NBA widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in
the world.

## Problem Statement<br />
As a sports Data Scientist working for an NBA team, you have been tasked to create a
solution that helps predicts whether the career length of a new rookie in the team NBA
will be =>5 or < 5.
Upon your implementation, you should outline the potential benefits of your solution to
the NBA management team while considering to renew player contracts.

## Dataset<br />
The dataset you have been provided with comes from data collected from games played
by players in their 1st year in the NBA. It includes all rookies from 1980-2016. They're
sorted by most minutes played and includes per game averages.
In the NBA, a rookie is any player who has never played a game in the NBA until that
year and the past 5 years.
